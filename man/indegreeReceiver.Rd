\usage{
indegreeReceiver(param = NULL, scaling = c("none", "std", "prop"))
}
\arguments{
\item{param}{numeric value, data.frame  or function with time parameter. Specifies the value of the effect for the statistic in the REM model}

\item{scaling}{the method for scaling the indegreeReceiver statistic. \code{"none"} [default] gives raw value of the statistic at time t, \code{"std"} the statistic is standardized per time point, and \code{"prop"} denotes proportional scaling in which raw counts are divided by the number of past events until time t.}
}
\description{
This function specifies the input for the indegreeReceiver effect in the \code{formula} argument for the function \code{\link{remulateTie}} or \code{\link{remulateActor}}. Not to be used independently
}
\details{
if param is a data frame, it must have three columns: sender, receiver, and value (numeric), 
representing the parameter value for thay dyadic pair. The data.frame must contain 
all pairs of actors or dyads corresponding to the riskset. 

if param is a function, it's first argument must be 't', corresponding to the time. The
function may have additional arguments.
