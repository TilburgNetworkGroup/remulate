Description: Model based simulation of dynamic networks under tie-oriented (Butts, C., 2008, <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x>) and actor-oriented (Stadtfeld, C., & Block, P., 2017, <doi:10.15195/v4.a14>) relational event models. Supports simulation from a variety of relational event model extensions, including temporal variability in effects, heterogeneity through dyadic latent class relational event models (DLC-REM), random effects, blockmodels, and memory decay in relational event models (Lakdawala, R., 2024 <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2403.19329>). The development of this package was supported by a Vidi Grant (452-17-006) awarded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) Grant and an ERC Starting Grant  (758791).
